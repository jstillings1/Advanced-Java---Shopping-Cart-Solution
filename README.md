This is my attempt at solving The shopping cart problem in the  Java class before I changed majors. The video link was broken and the actual requirements were unknown at the time of this creation.

NOTE: This was created based on incomplete data at the time. This is a solution to a problem BUT NOT the correct solution to the problem as presented in the video note.
This solution uses advanced error handling not covered in the course. Also uses AWT and Swing at a level far beyond the class work.
